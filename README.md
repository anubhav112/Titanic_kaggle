# Titanic_kaggle
This repository contains my code file of a machine learning model using linear svm which predicts results on Titaninc test sample as present on kaggle.

Just for learning
There are 4 files to take care about in this project:-

1. Titanic_dataset_with_SVM_linear.py: This file contains the main source code of the machine learning model. Here I have used SVM with linear kernal for modelling. The accuracy achieved as per Kaggle is 77.03% which is pretty average. However this code can serve as a good starting point to learning how to handle NaN values in dataset and basics of scikit-learn. Remove the comments near the last line to generate the output file.

2. Titanic_train.csv: This is the dataset on which the model is trained.

3. Titanic_test.csv: This is the dataset on which the model is tested. Accuracy obtained is 77.03%.

4. Titanic.csv: This is the output file generated by the code.
